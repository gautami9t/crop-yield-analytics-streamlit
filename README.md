# crop-yield-analytics-streamlit
An interactive dashboard for analyzing crop yield based on fertilizer, soil nutrients, and temperature using Streamlit 

ðŸ§¾ Features of the Smart Irrigation Dashboard
ðŸŒ± Overview
This interactive dashboard was built using Streamlit and a real-world dataset on soil nutrients, fertilizer use, temperature, and crop yield. It simulates decision-making scenarios for optimizing agricultural inputs in a data-driven way.

ðŸ”§ Real-Time Filtering with Sliders
What it Does:
The dashboard includes sliders that let users adjust values for:

Fertilizer

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

Temperature

Why It Matters:
This allows users to explore how crop yield changes when these inputs are varied. Itâ€™s similar to how a farmer or agronomist might test different growing conditions.

ðŸ“ˆ Live Visual and Statistical Updates
What it Does:
All graphs (scatter plots and heatmaps) and summary tables automatically update based on the selected input values.

Why It Matters:
This dynamic interactivity makes the dashboard feel responsive and user-friendly. Users instantly see how their input decisions affect crop performance.

ðŸ§ª What-if Simulation
What it Does:
Users can simulate real-world growing conditions by adjusting inputs. For example:

"What happens to yield if I reduce nitrogen to 60?"

"How does temperature affect productivity?"

Why It Matters:
This helps users make informed decisions without needing to experiment in the field. It acts like a virtual lab for agronomy or smart farming.

ðŸ“Š Visuals Included
Correlation Heatmap: Shows which inputs have the strongest relationship with yield.

Scatter Plots: Visualize direct comparisons between yield and each input variable.

Summary Statistics: Mean, min, max, and distribution of yield under chosen input ranges.
