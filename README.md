# crop-yield-analytics-streamlit
An interactive dashboard for analyzing crop yield based on fertilizer, soil nutrients, and temperature using Streamlit 

## 🧾 Features of the Smart Irrigation Dashboard

### 🌱 Overview

This interactive dashboard was built using **Streamlit** and a real-world dataset on soil nutrients, fertilizer use, temperature, and crop yield. It simulates decision-making scenarios for optimizing agricultural inputs in a data-driven way.

### 🔧 Real-Time Filtering with Sliders

**What it Does:**  
The dashboard includes sliders that let users adjust values for:

- Fertilizer  
- Nitrogen (N)  
- Phosphorus (P)  
- Potassium (K)  
- Temperature  

**Why It Matters:**  
This allows users to explore how crop yield changes when these inputs are varied. It’s similar to how a farmer or agronomist might test different growing conditions.

### 📈 Live Visual and Statistical Updates

**What it Does:**  
All graphs (scatter plots and heatmaps) and summary tables automatically update based on the selected input values.

**Why It Matters:**  
This dynamic interactivity makes the dashboard feel responsive and user-friendly. Users instantly see how their input decisions affect crop performance.

---

### 🧪 What-if Simulation

**What it Does:**  
Users can simulate real-world growing conditions by adjusting inputs. For example:

- "What happens to yield if I reduce nitrogen to 60?"
- "How does temperature affect productivity?"

**Why It Matters:**  
This helps users make informed decisions without needing to experiment in the field. It acts like a **virtual lab for agronomy** or smart farming.

---

### 📊 Visuals Included

- **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows which inputs have the strongest relationship with yield.  
- **Scatter Plots:** Visualize direct comparisons between yield and each input variable.  
- **Summary Statistics:** Mean, min, max, and distribution of yield under chosen input ranges.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Streamlit
- Power BI (separate `.pbix` visualization)
- CSV-based real-world agronomy dataset

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains columns for:

- `Fertilizer`
- `N` (Nitrogen), `P` (Phosphorus), `K` (Potassium)
- `temp` (Temperature in °C)
- `yeild` (Crop yield, target variable)
